# SonatusMatrixMultOa

### Arguments

The program accepts the following inputs:

1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Specify the dimensions of matrices `A` and `B` in the format `p q r`, where:
  `A = p x q` &
  `B = q x r`

  **Note**: All dimensions (p,q,r) must be less than 100.

2. **Number of Runs**: Indicate how many times to run tests with different matrices for average runtime. Use `1` to display the matrices.

### Example Input

```
Enter dimensions of matrix A (p x q), and B(q x r) as "p q r " (p,q,r < 100): 3 3 3
How many times to run (to test avg times), only '1' for matrix output: 1
```
